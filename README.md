# Meow

## Short description
I've always been an animal lover, and it broke my heart to see so many cats living on the streets, without a warm and caring family to call their own. However, I also noticed that there was a significant gap in technology when it came to helping people easily connect with these cats and rescue organizations. I wanted to bridge that gap and make it simple for anyone, even those without a technical background, to browse and adopt a cat in need. ‘Meow’ is not just an app; it's a platform where people can discover heartwarming stories of these resilient cats and offer them a chance at a better life.

## Domain details
Shortly, we should focus on our subject, the cat. Story: name, breed, gender, age, health problems, description

- name: the cat's temporally name (after adoption the person might or not change the cat’s name)
- breed: the specific breed or, if unknown, an indication of its appearance
- gender: whether the cat is male or female
- age: the cat's approximate age
- health_problems: any health issues or special needs the cat may have, if there is any
- description: a detailed and heartwarming description that highlights the cat's personality, interests, and needs, providing potential adopters with a genuine connection to each cat's story; this description is a key element in helping users make an informed and compassionate decision to adopt

## CRUD

- When using “Meow”, we want to be able to add a new cat to the list when we find a homeless one or if we have kittens and we cannot keep them. So, in order for this one to be adopted, we are thinking of a button, which redirects to a separate page. Here, we can enter all the necessary information for the cat and our personal email so, in this way people can reach us when they are adopting.
- We want to have the option of listing all the registered cats together. Here, we have for each item of list options for open details or edit details.
- Not every person is an expert in cats and some details like: breed, gender, age and health problems can be mistaken, reason why it is mandatory to give the user the possibility to modify the notes. We consider that a button for "update" is intuitive and by pressing it, the user will be redirected to a new page, in the same manner as for the "add" option, except the name and description cannot be modified.
- In order for a cat to be adopted you cannot delete it only if you take her/ him home. Because the purpose of this app is to help each animal is registered to be taken to their new home. That’s why when you adopt a cat it will happen a delete operation, because the information of that specific cat will not be in the list anymore.
